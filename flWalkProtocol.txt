1) Generate data
2) crop flies to a 200x200 box
3) track the centroid of the fly before cropping to back track and place the fly back on the orginal image
4) Segment the fly using trainable WEKA segmentator
5) get the leg tips coordinates
6) Label the legs starting L3, going clockwise and take care how many legs are being tracked
7) use head, tail, body centroids to differentiate the specific leg
8) after labeling the leg tips, generate specific plots for the gait pattern
